## Props

|  Name                      | Type      | Default      | Description     |
| -------------------------- |---------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| `className`                | string    |              | Custom class to override default styles. Can be used to add your own transition |
| `delay`                    | number    |    2000      | Time in milliseconds to wait until hiding the content |
| `hideCursor`               | boolean   |   false      | When set to true also hides the cursor inside the body of the document |
| `initialHide`              | boolean   |   false      | Marks whether it should hide the content by default or not |
| `showOnlyOnContainerHover` | boolean   |   false      | After hiding the component it only shows again if the mouse moves in the container. By default a mouse move in the whole document shows the content again |

## `useHideOnMouseStop` hook

By default react-hide-on-mouse-stop adds an extra container around your content, if you want to avoid that and have more control over the behavior of the hide process you can take advantage of `useHideOnMouseStop` hook, it's a bit more verbose and has less functionality but serves the same purpose. 
Take a look at the example bellow:

```jsx
import { useHideOnMouseStop } from 'react-hide-on-mouse-stop';

const App = () => {
    const [hide, onMouseEnter, onMouseLeave] = useHideOnMouseStop({ delay: 1000 });
    const className = /* write your styles using the hide variable to show/hide the content */;

    return (
        <div
            className={className}
            onMouseEnter={onMouseEnter}
            onMouseLeave={onMouseLeave}
        >
            Content to hide
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```
